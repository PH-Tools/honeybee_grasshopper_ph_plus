"""
Calculate an envelope infiltration rate (m3/s-m2) base on a specified ACH (Air Change Rate) value. This
is typical for PHI Passive House projects which use an ACH limiting value for Certification. Note that
this component will use the NET interior volume of the Spaces, so ensure that all of your Honeybee-Rooms
have Spaces added BEFORE using this component. The exterior envelope area will include all faces exposed
to the Ouotdoor air, or Ground, but not faces expose to Adiabatic or Surface conditions.

    Args:
        _ach_at_50Pa: The Air Change Rate (ACH) at 50Pa. Typical Values:
- PHI New Construction: 0.6 ACH@50Pa
- PHI EnerPHit: 1.0 ACH@50Pa
- PHI Low Energy Building: 1.0 ACH@50PA

        _hb_rooms: The Honeybee-Rooms to use as the reference volume and envelope area.
    
    Returns:
        infilt_per_exterior_at_50Pa_: The air infiltration (m3/s-m2) rate.
